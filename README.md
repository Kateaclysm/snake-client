# Snake Client Project

"Snake" is a very popular (and very old!) video game. The player maneuvers a "head" around and makes it "grow" by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As the head eats, it slowly gains a tail that becomes more and more of an obstacle as it grows longer. The goal of the game is to grow it to become as long as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which the game ends.

This is an attempt at a multiplayer version of "Snake".

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here.

## Controls:
**W, A, S, D** move the snake one position **Up, Left, Down, Right**, respectively.

**Ctrl + C** will terminate connection with the server and "end" the game immediately. 


## Getting Started

- Follow steps inside the snek server repo to run the server side
- Run the development snake client using the `node play.js` command.
